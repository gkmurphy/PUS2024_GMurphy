# PUS2024_GMurphy

This initial part of HW3 is focused on setting up and completing different hypothesis tests for categorical data. The demo follows a z test and the second example a chi square test which uses a continguency table that considers the difference between expexted and observed values for results. 

NOTE: I'm having issues with files permeating across the folders. I've tried deleting them, but they are still there. Apologies for the extra files. HW3 is as marked.
