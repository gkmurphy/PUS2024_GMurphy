## HW2

This homework was focused on loading and cleansing data so that we can form research questions in the the format of falsifiable hypothesis testing. There was definitely a learning curve in pulling different aspects of data based on date (especially in the larger citibike database). We used central tendancy, spread, and histograms to visualize both to understand what the data looks like from a descriptive/exploratory perspective before getting into deeper analysis. 

I worked alone and was responsible for all of the code.
